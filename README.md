# Keylogger
These stealthy programs can record every keystroke made on a computer, often without the user's knowledge.

While debugging the file, it's important to have had altered the threat and windows virus setting beforehand or else it tends to automatically delete the key-logger file on identifying it as a threat.
Windows Virus Threat & Protection -> Settings -> Add Exclusions -> Add keylogger file to the list

The output can be read on a log file where all the keystrokes data is read in a txt file.

# Overcoming Keyloggers:
1. System Hardening
2. Patch Management
3. IPS/IDS
